Around 2004 and 2005, while working on my AI thesis as an undergraduate and later during my PhD, 
I discovered the works of Ray Kurzweil. In his books, he predicted that by around 2030, 
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) would surpass human intelligence. He further projected that by 2045, 
we would reach a point of Singularity. I was captivated by his work, which had a profound influence on my career. 
Over the years, I have concluded that although I agree with the 2030 milestone for AI to surpass human capabilities, 
the 2045 prediction requires some adjustment, and here's why.

The current rate of technological advancement, which sees a doubling in price/performance roughly every 18 months, 
is dependent on humans. Humans are integral to the process; they make the decisions, build fabrication plants, 
and handle marketing, sales, and distribution. Once technology surpasses this human-centric phase, 
the rate of progress will increase exponentially compared to the current rate. 
The paradigm shift is closer than many people anticipate. 

Seven years from now the world will be powered by AGI.
